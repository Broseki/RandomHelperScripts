# RandomHelperScripts
Just random scripts that I use for my own purposes. Maybe they will be of use to somebody.

For a long time I created one-off scripts for doing setup of things, but recently I realized I need a central place to put these scripts in
case I need them in the future. These scripts do things like setup network shares, standing up secure reverse proxies, etc.

These are mostly poorly documented and are here so I can share these with people that have asked for them. If you need more information or help on something
from this repo you can email me (broseki at cavefox dot net) and I will get back to you when I have a free moment (as long as your email doesn't get buried).
